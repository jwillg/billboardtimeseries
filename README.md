## Application link
[Billboard top 100 BPM data](https://jwillg.github.io/billboardtimeseries/proj1.html)
## Overview
The purpose of this application is to visualize the billboard's top song data in order to compare BPM (beats per minute) using D3js. Data was obtained from kcmillersean at data.world and BPM data was obtained from tunebat. 
## Using the application
Instructions for using the application are explained in the video but there is also a condensed version of them in the live application link above.
## Data description
All of the data used to create the visualization is included in `data.csv` and were split into smaller files to easily access the particular position that the songs are at. The data used for the creation of the graph are WeekID and BPM; BPM, Song and Performer are used for the tooltips. 
## Findings
An interesting fact is the songs that are exclusively made for movie soundtracks will often crack the top 10 for a number of weeks. For instance, in this picture Earned It (Fifty Shades Of Grey) stayed in the top 10 starting from it's release date February 2015 until July 2015.
